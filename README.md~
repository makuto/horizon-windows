# horizon-windows
Everything needed to build Horizon on Windows

You need to clone [Horizon](http://www.github.com/makuto/horizon) and [base 2.0](http://www.github.com/makuto/base2.0) as well. Place them at the same level as this project (for example, you would have Git/horizon, Git/horizon-windows, and Git/base2.0).
